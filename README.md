# MyAstroCatalog

As a beginner in astrophotography, I wanted to start by capturing the most beautiful objects in our sky and I discovered the Messier catalog. I set out to photograph it completely, and wanted to track my progress. From there, the idea of [​​My Astro Catalog](https://myastrocatalog.ddns.net/) was born! Collect and organize my collection and then be able to generate a photo of the complete catalog.

If you encounter any problems or have any suggestions, please feel free to create an issue on this repository.
